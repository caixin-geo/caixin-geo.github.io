Here is **Xin Cai** (**Geoffey**, **蔡鑫**).

I am a senior undergrad majoring in **HCI** and **Serious Game Design** at Shanghai JiaoTong University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Gu](https://designschool.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher/31104c124abec4f853ad19c8530ab586/professor/detail/5ec6b6d1c4b4b304afeb5737)
and [A.P.Liu](https://designschool.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher/31104c124abec4f853ad19c8530ab586/viceprofessor/detail/5ecf73a0ead9bc12b4a46df7) of [Interaction Design Institute](https://designschool.sjtu.edu.cn/research/institution/detail/650aae90614c35f70ea1c698).
