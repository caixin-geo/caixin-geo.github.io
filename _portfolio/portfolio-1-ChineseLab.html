"Hanzi Lab" is an AR-based game for 3-6-year-old kids, involving iPad scanning of Chinese character cards to create new characters. It features the innovative Etymology Literacy Method and AR Experimental Game, crucial for cognitive development. AR games offer immersive virtual models, physical cards, and unique interaction. They enhance concrete thinking. This design breaks the mold in children's character recognition. It fosters holistic development, creative thinking, and open-minded character learning. It's a key to unlocking children's potential.
