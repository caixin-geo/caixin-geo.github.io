excerpt: "
&quot;Chinese Lab&quot;is an AR-based educational app designed for children aged 3-6 to introduce them to the construction of Chinese characters.
It features the innovative <strong>Etymology Literacy Method</strong> and <strong>AR Experimental Game</strong>, cleverly integrating the theory of Chinese character construction with game design.
This design breaks the mold in children's character recognition and fosters holistic development, creative thinking, and open-minded character learning.
