<ul>
    <li>It utilizes multimedia elements, including text, sound, animations, special effects, etc.. to enhance the storytelling experience.</li>
    <li>This app helps with storytelling of <i>Arcadia</i>, which is inspired by the classical literary work "The Peach Blossom Spring" -- 
        <i>Set in a future society, the "Peach Blossom Plan" attempts to create an ideal home with the bio-structure "Peach Blossom Giant Tree" and advanced AI "Kirin." However, this artificial utopia conceals unresolved crises with a disrupted balance between technology and nature. The protagonist, Ling, accidentally enters this tech-enriched peach grove and ventures into the inner world of "Kirin," embarking on a fantastical journey to unveil the hidden truths of the society. </i>
