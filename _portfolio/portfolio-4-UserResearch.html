title: "Design Research - Overseas Rental Service"
linkOn: "off"
excerpt: "
The project originated from a collaborative course, <i>Design Research</i>, between the International Design Department of Ant Design and the School of Design of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
In this course, we focused on rental service for overseas students and conducted related user research and service design, including user research, requirement analysis, functional design and low/high fidelity implementation.
This process not only enhanced the our practical skills but also facilitated an effective integration of theory and practice.
